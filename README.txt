# Alpine moths and predator control
Ludovic Dutoit (dutoit.ludovic@gmail.com)

### Description

This project aims at understanding how predator control affected alpine moths diversity. 

The raw collected data is in raw_data/raw.csv

The metadata describing sites is in raw_data/metadata.txt.

The data analysis is in analysis.R creating a plot Figures/abundance_family.pdf

I am doing an Anova per site in anova.R for visualising species abundancy by site.
