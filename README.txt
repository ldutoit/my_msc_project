### Description

This project aims at understanding how predator control affected alpine moths diversity. 

The raw collected data is in raw_data/raw.csv

The metadata describing sites is in raw_data/metadata.txt.

The data analysis is in anova.R

I tried some plotting with plot.R for visualising species abundancy by site

The figures are in Figures/
